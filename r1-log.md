### R1D13 (4/11/25)

I participated in the huddle for 100Devs. I also completed the first page for the homework that was assigned for class 08. It is the Level Ground page. I also spent time making it responsive across different size devices. This was harder than I thought, not to mention I'm not the biggest fan of floats, so I will need to work more on that.
